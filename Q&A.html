    <h2>Newborn Beginnings: Understanding Your Baby’s First Steps in Life</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>1. What should new parents expect during the first week with a newborn, and how can they prepare for it?</strong>
      <p class="answer">The first week is a major adjustment. Expect frequent feeding (every 2–3 hours), irregular sleep, and lots of diaper changes. Parents should prepare by stocking up on essentials, arranging support from friends or family, and resting when possible. Emotional ups and downs are normal, especially for new mothers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>2. How often should a newborn be fed, and what are the signs that they are getting enough milk or formula?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Newborns typically eat 8–12 times in 24 hours. Signs they’re getting enough include regular wet and dirty diapers, steady weight gain, and contentment after feeding. If breastfeeding, the baby should have audible swallows and a proper latch.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>3. What are common reasons a baby cries, and how can parents learn to soothe their baby effectively?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Babies cry to communicate hunger, discomfort, tiredness, or overstimulation. Parents can try feeding, changing the diaper, swaddling, gentle rocking, or white noise. Over time, they’ll learn their baby's cues and preferences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>4. When should a baby start seeing a pediatrician regularly, and what happens during those visits?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Babies typically have a checkup within the first week, then at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months. These visits track growth, development, immunizations, and allow parents to ask questions. The doctor checks weight, length, head circumference, and developmental milestones.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>5. What are safe sleep practices for babies to reduce the risk of SIDS?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Babies should sleep on their backs on a firm, flat mattress with no soft bedding, pillows, or toys. Room-sharing without bed-sharing is recommended for at least the first 6 months. Avoid overheating and ensure smoke-free environments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>6. How can parents support their baby's language development in the early months?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Talking, singing, and reading to babies from birth supports language skills. Responding to coos and babbling encourages communication. Even narrating daily tasks like changing or feeding builds understanding and vocabulary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>7. What are the signs of colic in babies, and what can parents do to manage it?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Colic often involves intense crying for 3+ hours a day, 3+ days a week, for 3+ weeks. It usually starts around 2 weeks and resolves by 3–4 months. Comfort measures include holding the baby upright, using white noise, and trying a pacifier. Always check with a doctor to rule out medical issues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>8. When do babies typically begin teething, and what are common symptoms and remedies?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Teething usually starts around 6 months. Signs include drooling, chewing on objects, irritability, and swollen gums. Remedies include teething rings, cold washcloths, or teething toys. Avoid teething gels with benzocaine in young babies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>9. How can parents bond with their baby, especially in the early months when babies can’t communicate much?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Holding, cuddling, skin-to-skin contact, eye contact, and talking to the baby build strong emotional connections. Responding consistently to the baby's needs fosters trust and attachment, which is essential for emotional development.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>10. What vaccinations do babies receive in their first year, and why are they important?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Common vaccines include Hepatitis B, DTaP, Hib, Polio, Rotavirus, and PCV. These protect against serious diseases. Following the recommended schedule helps keep babies and the community safe through herd immunity.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Everyday Baby Care: Building Routines and Reading the Signs</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>11. How can parents tell if their baby is developing at a healthy pace, and when should they be concerned?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Tracking milestones like smiling, babbling, sitting, crawling, and responding to sounds helps. Each baby develops at their own pace, but major delays or loss of skills should be brought up with a pediatrician. Regular checkups are key for catching issues early.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>12. What are the benefits of skin-to-skin contact with a baby, and how often should it be done?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Skin-to-skin contact helps regulate the baby’s body temperature, heartbeat, and breathing. It also supports bonding and breastfeeding. It can be done daily, especially in the first weeks, and is beneficial for both moms and dads.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>13. What are some signs that a baby might be allergic to a formula or food, and what should parents do?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Symptoms include rash, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in stool, excessive gas, or irritability after eating. Severe signs include swelling or difficulty breathing. In any case, stop the suspected food/formula and consult a pediatrician immediately.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>14. How can parents encourage healthy physical activity in babies, even before they can walk?</strong>

    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>15. What’s the best way to handle diaper rash, and how can it be prevented?</strong>

    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>16. How can you tell if a baby is overheating or too cold, and how should you dress them for sleep?</strong>
      <p class="answer">A baby who is too hot might sweat, have flushed skin, or breathe rapidly. Cold babies may have cool extremities. Dress babies in one more layer than adults wear for sleep, and use wearable blankets instead of loose blankets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>17. What are some helpful tips for introducing a bottle to a breastfed baby?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Start after breastfeeding is well established (usually around 4–6 weeks). Have someone else offer the bottle while the mother is not in sight. Try different nipples if needed, and be patient—it might take time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>18. How often should a baby’s nails be trimmed, and how can it be done safely?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Trim nails once or twice a week to prevent scratching. Use baby nail scissors or a file while the baby is asleep or calm. Press the fingertip pad away from the nail to avoid cutting the skin.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>19. When should babies start seeing a dentist, and how can parents care for their baby’s oral health before that?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Babies should see a dentist by their first birthday or when the first tooth appears. Before then, clean gums with a damp cloth and use a soft-bristled baby toothbrush once teeth emerge. Avoid putting babies to bed with a bottle to prevent decay.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>20. How can parents help their baby develop good sleep habits without using cry-it-out methods?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Establish a consistent bedtime routine, respond to the baby’s cues, and gradually teach self-soothing with gentle methods like pick-up-put-down or the chair method. Creating a calm sleep environment also supports better sleep.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>22. How can parents tell if their baby has a fever, and what steps should they take?</strong>
      <p class="answer">A rectal temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher is considered a fever in babies. For infants under 3 months, call the doctor immediately. Keep the baby hydrated, dress lightly, and follow your pediatrician's guidance—never give medication without checking dosage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>23. What’s the difference between reflux and spit-up, and when should parents be concerned?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Spit-up is normal and painless. Reflux may cause discomfort, poor feeding, or slow weight gain. Frequent projectile vomiting, arching, or refusal to eat should prompt a visit to the doctor for evaluation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>24. How can you introduce a pacifier safely, and what are the pros and cons of pacifier use?</strong>

    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>28. How do babies communicate before they can talk, and how can parents understand their cues better?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Babies use facial expressions, cries, gestures, and body language. Parents can learn patterns—like a hungry cry vs. tired cry—and respond consistently. Baby sign language can also support communication before speech.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <strong>29. What are the benefits of babywearing, and what safety guidelines should be followed?</strong>
      <p class="answer">Babywearing promotes bonding, soothes babies, and frees up parents’ hands. Ensure the baby’s face is visible, airways are clear, and the hips are well-supported in an "M" position to prevent hip dysplasia.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <strong>37. What should parents know about introducing allergens like peanuts and eggs?</strong>
    <p class="answer">Introduce common allergens early (around 6 months), especially if there’s no family history of allergies. Offer them in small amounts and observe for reactions. Consult a doctor first if the baby has eczema or other risk factors.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <strong>38. How can parents encourage independence while still keeping their baby safe?</strong>
    <p class="answer">Offer choices, let the baby try feeding themselves, and allow exploration within safe limits. Encourage trying new things while staying close for reassurance. Building independence helps confidence and problem-solving.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <strong>39. How much screen time is okay for babies, and what are healthier alternatives?</strong>

  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <strong>40. What are the signs that a baby is ready to transition from two naps to one, and how can parents manage the change?</strong>
    <p class="answer">If the baby resists the second nap or wakes earlier than usual, it may be time. This usually happens between 12–18 months. Gradually shift the morning nap later and stretch wake times slowly to adjust.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>First Days, First Wonders: Navigating the Newborn Experience</h2>
  <div class="question">
    <strong>41. What are the key developmental milestones a baby should reach in their first year of life, and how can parents support their baby in achieving them?</strong>
    <p class="answer">During the first year, babies typically learn to hold up their head, roll over, sit without support, crawl, stand, and possibly take their first steps. Cognitive and language milestones include responding to their name, babbling, and showing curiosity. Parents can support this by providing a safe, stimulating environment, engaging in plenty of face-to-face interaction, reading to their baby, and giving them supervised floor time for physical exploration.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <strong>42. Why is tummy time important for babies, and how often should it be done?</strong>
